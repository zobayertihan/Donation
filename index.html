            for them. We are trying to provide food for them. We are trying to offer them pure drinking water. We are
            trying to provide the medicine. We are trying to give them some educational activities.</p>

                <p>To live, a family needs food and pure drinking water. So, we are trying to provide food and drinking
                    water first. We are trying to give them a minimum amount of food and water for everyone.</p>

                <p>After food, people need shelter to live. So we are trying to provide a hygienic place to live for
                    them.</p>

                <p>By this disaster, education processes are disturbed. That is harmful to a nation. We know "Education
                    is the backbone of a nation". That's why we are trying to provide them with some educational
                    activities.</p>

                <p class="special-details">Natural disasters can have a life-altering impact on the individuals and
                    families fortunate enough to survive them. But the effect of natural disasters can be felt at the
                    community, city, and state level, or many times can impact an entire country. Natural disasters can
                    have huge environmental impacts as well, even when human communities are relatively unaffected. How
                    well the impact of a disaster event is absorbed has much to do with the intensity of the impact and
                    the level of preparedness and resilience of the subject impacted. Natural disasters cause
                    destruction of property, loss of financial resources, and personal injury or illness. The loss of
                    resources, security, and access to the shelter can lead to massive population migrations in
                    lesser-developed countries. By collecting donations we are helping people to fight these natural
                    disasters. And we will do this till the end.</p>
